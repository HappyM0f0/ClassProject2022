# Proposal

## Topic:
a question, the goal, etc

Looking into 2022, we want to ask what cities within the United States would provide the best environment for Start-Ups and young business owners—using data from StartUpBlink (an Analytics group that focuses on Start-Ups Ecosystem on a global scale), the US Census, and data from Barrons(a Financial and Investments magazine). This data will provide actionable insight for individuals creating and starting their businesses.

Measurements will include the general working population, education, median household income, Business Environment (StartUpBlink), and local real estate listings changes(Barrons).

Unfold the analysis with the business environment and what that means for a business, then move to available workers, followed by the typical cost of living adjustments and needs in selected cities. We could also include local business news information for cultural identity.

## Tech Stack:
the tools & technology used for the project

Python will be used to clean the data (some transformation). Finally, a static website (bootstrap) will display an analysis, including charts and graphs of relevant information. The data displayed will be dynamic, with significant cities selecting specific information. 

Use Tableau and SQL to transform and analyze the data sets. Create Static Charts and experiment with dashboard layouts.

## Deliverable(s):
smaller actions/steps to be taken. Make sure these can be broken down into issues.

- Data set is viewable, sorts, and dynamically changes with selection.
- Dashboard is clean and provides information to the viewer
- Analysis page contains information on how the analysis can assist the viewer

What the final  project will be (website, dashboard, analysis, etc).
- Final form will be a Static website displaying a data set dashboard and a section to review the analysis.

Successes metrics 
- Submission for group review on Saturday before due day of Monday.

## Timeline
create a schedule for you group to follow to keep you on track and also help yourselves scope out your project.
