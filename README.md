Title: US Start up Ecosystem Index in Relation to Cost of Living.

# Project Proposal: 
We want to ask what cities within the United States would provide the best environment for Start-Ups and young business owners-using data from StartupBlink, the US Census and data from Barrons. This data will proivde actionable insight for individuals creating and starting their business. Measurements include the general working population, education, median household income, business environment and local real estate listings. The final anaylsis will reveal how the business environment impacts the business, also how the availaibly of labor and the typical cost of living adjustments impact the businesses.

  # Cost of Living Index
  The cost of living index gives us insight into housing affordability, expenses, health care costs, and overall standard of living. As a business you are able to use the cost of living index information 
  
In the below example business score and cost of living are compared between various cities across the United States. Our bucket system reveals the highest cost of living cities are mostly bigger metropolitian cities, and some of the lower cost of living is some of the smaller cities and metro areas.

In the below example we see that San Francisco has a business score of 3.80 and so do many of the leading cities, versus various quantity scores, quantity score in this case is higher for SF but the ease of doing business remains the same in other cities with a lower quantity score such as Austin or Dallas.

This below example shows us that busines and quantity scores by buckets and we see more of an alignment between the business score and quantity score in the lower buckets versus higher buckets, this is turn shows us that the higher bucketed cities are not necessarily the most qualified cities for doing business. Some of lower bucketed cities can provide more ease of doing business with more of an alignment between business score and quantity scores.
