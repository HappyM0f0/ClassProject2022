This data will proivde actionable insight for individuals creating and starting their business. Measurements include the general working population, education, median household income, business environment and local real estate listings. The final anaylsis will reveal how the business environment impacts the business, also how the availaibly of labor and the typical cost of living adjustments impact the businesses.
