Class project for UT Boot Camp for Data Analytics<br>
Title: US Start up Ecosystem Index in Relation to Cost of Living.

# Project Proposal: 
We want to ask what cities within the United States would provide the best environment for Start-Ups and young business owners-using data from StartupBlink, the US Census and data from Barrons. This data will provide actionable insight for individuals creating and starting their business. Measurements include the general working population, education, median household income, business environment and local real estate listings. The final analysis will reveal how the business environment impacts the business, also how the availability of labor and the typical cost of living adjustments impact the businesses. 

# Business Score/Bucketed Data
We used python to create buckets for our data, this helped us display our data more cleanly

 In the below example we see that San Francisco has a business score of 3.80 and so do many of the leading cities, versus various quantity scores, quantity score in this case is higher for SF but the ease of doing business remains the same in other cities with a lower quantity score such as Austin or Dallas.

  # Cost of Living Index/Business Score- Bar Chart
  The Cost-of-Living Index gives us insight into housing affordability, expenses, health care costs, and overall standard of living. As a business you can use the Cost-of-Living Index information to help price your goods and services and how much you should be paying your employees.
  
In the below example the Business Score and Cost of Living are compared between various cities across the United States. Our bucket system reveals the highest cost of living cities are mostly bigger metropolitan cities, and some of the lower Cost of Living comes from some of the smaller cities and metro areas.

 # Quantity Score/Business Score-Bar Chart

This below example shows us that business and quantity scores by buckets and we see more of an alignment between the Business Score and Quantity Score in the lower buckets versus higher buckets, this is turn shows us that the higher bucketed cities are not necessarily the most qualified cities for doing business. Some of lower bucketed cities can provide more ease of doing business with more of an alignment between Business Score and Quantity Scores.

# Results
Our data shows us that the cities that had the highest bucketed Business Scores were not necessarily the best places to do business. We can find other cities based on our bucketed data that show us better Cost of Living and comparable Business Scores. High Quantity score bucketed cities might lead to saturation in the workplace of workers with similar skill sets, In order to gain diversity looking at lower bucketed cities with lower Cost of Living and Business Scores that are similar to the higher buckets maybe advantageous for potential of growth of a Start-Up. 

# Things to Consider
After our research and gathering data sets from Startup Blink and Advisor Smith. We discovered things we would like further data on, we would like more information on remote workers so we can use that data to see how they factor into our overall Business and Quantity scores and how their Cost of Living would affect our Start-up businesses. Also, we would have liked to have access to the entire Start up Blink database to get more information on industry rankings, however the cost of getting access was $1600 and not affordable.
