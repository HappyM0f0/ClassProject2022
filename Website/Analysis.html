                        North America<br><br>
                        North America has a total of 297 startup ecosystems in the global 
                        top 1000, with 267 from the United States and 30 from Canada. Mexico was included in the 
                        Latin America & Caribbean region.<br><br>
                        In 2021, the US maintained its unrivalled position as highest ranking country globally, with 
                        4 cities in the global top 10. Canada is now ranked 4th globally after a decrease from 3rd 
                        last year, and has seen a significant decrease in its overall score, widening its gap from the 
                        Big 3 countries (The US, UK and Israel). <br>
                        At the city level, one of the most notable changes in this region includes Washington DCâ€™s 
                        jump to 8th in North America and 19th in the world.<br><br>
                        We have also seen significant increases from US cities like Philadelphia (Increasing 9 
                        positions to 35th), Minneapolis (Increasing 7 positions to 43rd), and Phoenix (Increasing 5 
                        positions to 47th) as they secure positions in the global top 50. <br><br>
                        North American dominance extends to all 
                        the ranked industries San Francisco in 11 
                        industries and New York in 1 industry.<br><br>

                    The core question of the Quantity score is: How many?<br><br>
                    A robust startup ecosystem not only comprises startups, but must have supporting 
                    organizations that provide resources, networking, and access to capital. The Quantity score 
                    checks the activity level of an ecosystem through its stakeholders and other signals. <br><br>
                    Among the elements taken into account for the calculation of the Quantity score are:<br><br>
                    - Number of Startups <br>
                    - Number of Coworking Spaces<br>
                    - Number of Accelerators<br>
                    - Number of Startup related Meetups<br><br>
                    Some of this data is supplemented from our Global Data Partners, mainly from Meetup and 
                    Coworker.</p></div>

                <div class="col-md-3"><p class="text-center">3. Business environment<br><br>
                    The factor affecting the rankings is unique, since it 
                    focuses on general indicators connected to infrastructure, business 
                    environment, ecosystem critical mass, and the ability to freely 
                    operate as a startup founder in each country.<br>
                    The Business Environment score, to which we shortly refer as Business score, is mainly 
                    focused on parameters at the country level, since national infrastructure, policies, and 
                    legislation generally affects all cities within a country. <br>
                    The main component of the Business score is a weighted average which takes into account 
                    a broad range of elements within each country, as presented in the list below. In addition, 
                    the Business score also measures a threshold of critical mass in both quantity and quality 
                    across all ecosystems, which can explain the difference in score between cities in the same 
                    country. <br>
                    As our policy is to avoid assumptions on the causes influencing the success of an 
                    ecosystem, we do our best to avoid indicators that might have an ambiguous influence, 
                    and only take into account those which are clearly negative or positive. For example, 
                    painfully slow internet, or massive restrictions in internet use, will most likely form an 
                    obstacle to the growth of the ecosystem. On the other hand, we disregard elements like 
                    cost of living, since its influence can be both positive and negative on an ecosystem.<br> 
                    Among the elements taken into account for the calculation of the Business score in each 
                    ecosystem are:<br><br>
                    - Ease of Doing Business and registering companies<br>
                    - Internet Speed<br>
                    - Internet Freedom<br>
                    - R&D investment <br>
                    - Availability of various technological services (payment portals, ride-sharing apps, 
                    cryptocurrency)<br>
                    - Number of patents per capita<br>
                    - Level of English proficiency<br>

                        The cities are indexed to 100, with 100 being the average cost of living for the United States.<br><br>
                        Index values above 100 indicate that the city has a cost of living above the average, while values below 100 indicate a cost of living below the average.<br><br>
