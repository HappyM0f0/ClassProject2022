1. Quantity Score
The core question of the Quantity score is: How many?
A robust startup ecosystem not only comprises startups, but must have supporting 
organizations that provide resources, networking, and access to capital. The Quantity score 
checks the activity level of an ecosystem through its stakeholders and other signals. 
Among the elements taken into account for the calculation of the Quantity score are:
- Number of Startups 
- Number of Coworking Spaces
- Number of Accelerators
- Number of Startup related Meetups
Some of this data is supplemented from our Global Data Partners, mainly from Meetup and 
Coworker.


3. Business environment
The third and final factor affecting the rankings is unique, since it 
focuses on general indicators connected to infrastructure, business 
environment, ecosystem critical mass, and the ability to freely 
operate as a startup founder in each country.
The Business Environment score, to which we shortly refer as Business score, is mainly 
focused on parameters at the country level, since national infrastructure, policies, and 
legislation generally affects all cities within a country. 
The main component of the Business score is a weighted average which takes into account 
a broad range of elements within each country, as presented in the list below. In addition, 
the Business score also measures a threshold of critical mass in both quantity and quality 
across all ecosystems, which can explain the difference in score between cities in the same 
country. 
As our policy is to avoid assumptions on the causes influencing the success of an 
ecosystem, we do our best to avoid indicators that might have an ambiguous influence, 
and only take into account those which are clearly negative or positive. For example, 
painfully slow internet, or massive restrictions in internet use, will most likely form an 
obstacle to the growth of the ecosystem. On the other hand, we disregard elements like 
cost of living, since its influence can be both positive and negative on an ecosystem. 
Among the elements taken into account for the calculation of the Business score in each 
ecosystem are:
- Ease of Doing Business and registering companies
- Internet Speed
- Internet Freedom
- R&D investment 
- Availability of various technological services (payment portals, ride-sharing apps, 
cryptocurrency)
- Number of patents per capita
- Level of English proficiency



North America
At the city level, one of the most notable changes in this region includes Washington DC’s 
jump of 11 spots to 8th in North America and 19th in the world.
We have also seen significant increases from US cities like Philadelphia (Increasing 9 
positions to 35th), Minneapolis (Increasing 7 positions to 43rd), and Phoenix (Increasing 5 
positions to 47th) as they secure positions in the global top 50. 
While many Canadian cities have seen a decrease in global rankings, Toronto, Vancouver, 
and Montreal remain in the global top 50. North American dominance extends to all 
the ranked industries, where US cities are not only highest ranked (San Francisco in 11 
industries and New York in 1 industry), but the gap between US and non-US cities is 
massive across almost all industries.
